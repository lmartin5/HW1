    <h1>Homework 1</h1>
    <p>I am excited to take web development this semester. From everyone that I have 
        talked to, it seems that a <strong><em>large</em></strong> 
        majority of CS jobs are directly related to web 
        development. Although I don't know if I <em>actually</em>
        want to go straight into industry after I graduate, I think it is important 
        to have a basic understanding of how websites and web apps are created for 
        an education in computer science.

        Shown above is a picture of some of the coolest footwear on 
        the market, the Lightning McQueen crocs. Further information can be found
        in an article published by 
        <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/lightning-mcqueen-crocs-sold-out/" target="_blank">The Wrap</a>.
